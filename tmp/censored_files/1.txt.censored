Thanks for your response.  I have two initial comments/questions:

1.  I don't understand "D" in the formula shown in # 2 for AAF.  What is it,
how it is determined?  If ███████████████ ██, SO, and ████████████, what is
left for "D"?

2.  If TVA only has rights to 4 of the 6 █████, how would gas imbalance
charges be handled if both TVA and Enron are supply gas for the total █████?
Certainly there will be situations were █████ trip or fail to start, etc.
which will lead to imbalances.
